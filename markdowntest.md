- Hello
- This is a list
- Bye

How to acquire a sandwich
1. Call your girlfriend
2. Tell her to make you a sandwich
3. Have her make the sandwich and bring it to you, congratulations

And... Depression moment
1. Cry about it
  - Skill issue
    - There are federal agents outside your house
    
Here's how you can track the progress of your sandwich request:
- [x] Demand sandwich
- [ ] Have her watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IwVWA2HY5M&ab_channel=Laina
- [ ] Make sure that she makes you a sandwich
- [ ] \(Optional) Call technical support if you encounter any problems

@github/support You're so lame

This is how I feel most of the time :poop:

Paragraphs are nice.

Footnote example:
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

\*OK boomer\*.
